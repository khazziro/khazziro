Hi, I'm **Renato**!

I'm a self-taught **Front-end Developer** who's currently learning React. My ultimate goal is to secure a job as a front-end developer, and this README is a brief overview of my skills, projects, and goals.

### Skills
- HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design
- JavaScript
- WordPress
- ReactJS
- Git
- GitHub, BitBucket
- Sass, PostCSS
- npm, yarn, pnpm
- Vite
    

### Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. [Omnifood](https://omnifood-with-javascript.netlify.app/) - This project was built using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I made a landing page for my portofolio while learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

2. [Image Gallery](https://khazzirogallery.netlify.app/) - This is a React-based web application that utilizes the Pixabay API to display a gallery of images. We used the Vite build tool to quickly set up the development environment and integrated the popular Tailwind CSS framework for a sleek and modern UI design.


### Goals 
My main goal is to secure a job as a front-end developer, where I can use my skills to build and maintain high-quality websites and applications. I'm eager to learn new technologies and techniques, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.
